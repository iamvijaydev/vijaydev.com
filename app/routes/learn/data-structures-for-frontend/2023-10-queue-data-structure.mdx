## Introduction
In the previous tutorial, we learned about linked lists and their operations. In this tutorial, we will explore another fundamental data structure called a queue. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. It is similar to a queue of people waiting in line to buy tickets at a movie theater. In this tutorial, we will discuss the properties, operations, and applications of queues in programming. Let's get started!

A queue is a collection of elements that supports two main operations:

1. **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the back of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removing an element from the front of the queue.

The elements in a queue are processed in the order they were added, with the oldest element being removed first. Queues are commonly used in algorithms and applications that require processing elements in a specific order, such as task scheduling, network packet routing, and printer job management. Let's explore the properties and operations of queues in more detail.

## Properties of Queues
Queues have the following properties:

1. **FIFO (First In First Out)**: The element that is added first is the one that is removed first.
2. **Linear Structure**: Elements are stored in a linear sequence.
3. **Dynamic Size**: The size of the queue can grow or shrink during the execution of a program.
4. **Efficient Insertion and Deletion**: Adding and removing elements from the queue is efficient.

Queues are commonly implemented using arrays or linked lists. In this tutorial, we will focus on implementing a queue using an array. Let's look at the operations supported by a queue.

## Operations on Queues
Queues support the following operations:

1. **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the back of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removing an element from the front of the queue.
3. **Peek**: Viewing the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checking if the queue is empty.
5. **isFull**: Checking if the queue is full (for fixed-size queues).

These operations are essential for working with queues and are used in many algorithms and applications. Let's look at each operation in more detail. We will implement a queue using an array and demonstrate how each operation works. Let's get started! 

## Implementing a Queue using an Array
We can implement a queue using an array in JavaScript. Here is an example of a simple queue implementation:

```javascript
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  enqueue(element) {
    this.items.push(element);
  }

  dequeue() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Underflow";
    }
    return this.items.shift();
  }

  peek() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Queue is empty";
    }
    return this.items[0];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }

  printQueue() {
    let str = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < this.items.length; i++) {
      str += this.items[i] + " ";
    }
    return str;
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `Queue` class that represents a queue data structure. The `items` array stores the elements of the queue. We implement the `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `peek`, `isEmpty`, and `printQueue` methods to perform operations on the queue. Let's look at each method in more detail.

## Operations on a Queue
Let's explore the operations supported by a queue:

### Enqueue
The `enqueue` operation adds an element to the back of the queue. It is implemented by pushing the element to the end of the array. Here is an example of using the `enqueue` operation:

```javascript
let queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(10);
queue.enqueue(20);
queue.enqueue(30);
console.log(queue.printQueue()); // Output: 10 20 30
```

### Dequeue
The `dequeue` operation removes an element from the front of the queue. It is implemented by shifting the first element from the array. Here is an example of using the `dequeue` operation:

```javascript
let queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(10);
queue.enqueue(20);
queue.enqueue(30);
queue.dequeue();
console.log(queue.printQueue()); // Output: 20 30
```

### Peek
The `peek` operation returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it. It is implemented by accessing the first element of the array. Here is an example of using the `peek` operation:

```javascript
let queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(10);
queue.enqueue(20);
queue.enqueue(30);
console.log(queue.peek()); // Output: 10
```

### isEmpty
The `isEmpty` operation checks if the queue is empty. It returns `true` if the queue is empty and `false` otherwise. Here is an example of using the `isEmpty` operation:

```javascript
let queue = new Queue();
console.log(queue.isEmpty()); // Output: true
queue.enqueue(10);
console.log(queue.isEmpty()); // Output: false
```

### Print Queue
The `printQueue` operation prints the elements of the queue. It is useful for debugging and visualization. Here is an example of using the `printQueue` operation:

```javascript
let queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(10);
queue.enqueue(20);
queue.enqueue(30);
console.log(queue.printQueue()); // Output: 10 20 30
```

These operations are essential for working with queues and are used in many algorithms and applications. Let's summarize what we have learned in this tutorial.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored the concept of a queue, a fundamental data structure in programming. We discussed the properties, operations, and applications of queues, including the FIFO principle and the operations supported by queues. We implemented a simple queue using an array and demonstrated how to perform operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, and printQueue. Queues are versatile data structures that are used in many algorithms and applications. Understanding queues and their operations is essential for building efficient software solutions. In the next tutorial, we will explore other types of queues, such as priority queues and circular queues. Stay tuned!
